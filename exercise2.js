 * Make a function which can receive two parameters.
 * This function must return the sum of those parameters.
 * It means that the parameters must be numbers.
 * If one of the parameters is different than a number the function must return null.
 * Make an unit tests for this function.
 * You need to guarantee:
 *
 * - When the function receives the number 2 as first parameter
 * and the number two as the second, the function must return 4.
 *
 * - When the function receives the first parameter as not a number
 * the function must return null.
 *
 * - When the function receives the second parameter as not a number
